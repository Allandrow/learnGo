LearnGo is a simple CLI application written in Go to learn the basics of the language. It mainly features:

- Printing to the console
- Gathering user input
- Validating user input
- Basic data structures
- Functions, package and scopes

The application is a conference manager, where it handles conferences in different cities, each with a varying amount of available tickets.

The user will need to select a city from the selection. Once selected the application will list the people who will attend in a formatted way, notify the remaining number of tickets and incquire about the desired amount.

If the amount is above the remaining tickets the application will notify it and the user will be able to retry.

Once the amount of tickets is settled, the application will require some basic information from the user: first name, last name and email.

Afterwards the user will get sent back to the start of the program where he can select a city.
